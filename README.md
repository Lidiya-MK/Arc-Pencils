# Arc-Pencils

I have been wanting to experiment with Minimalist Design for quite some time. This is a simple website with HTML and CSS that follows this design trend. The website is meant for a Drawing pencil company called "Arc Pencil".

Here are some of the mockups from my figma design for the website: 
<div style="text-align: center; display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 5px; justify-content: center;">
  <div>
    <img style="width: 45%;" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4412e108-8f70-4550-9a4b-bfccc0d65aad" alt="Image 1">
    <img style="width: 45%;" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ebc8a5a-15c6-469b-b23e-fd643d5d7fa8" alt="Image 2">
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <img style="width: 45%;" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a6c6c8b-9bbd-4b22-8100-7fd269910ba7" alt="Image 3">
    <img style="width: 45%;" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03b062ca-5f4b-452a-aea4-2b6403db7650" alt="Image 4">
  </div>
