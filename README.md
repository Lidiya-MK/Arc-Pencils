# Arc-Pencils

I have been wanting to experiment with minimalist website design for quite some time. This is a simple website with HTML and CSS that follows this design trend. The website is meant for a Drawing pencil company called "Arc Pencil".

Here are some of the mockups from my figma design for the website:

<div align= center>
<img  width = "50%"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4412e108-8f70-4550-9a4b-bfccc0d65aad">
<img width = "50%"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ebc8a5a-15c6-469b-b23e-fd643d5d7fa8"  >
</div>

<div align= center>
<img  width = "50%"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a6c6c8b-9bbd-4b22-8100-7fd269910ba7">
<img width = "50%"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03b062ca-5f4b-452a-aea4-2b6403db7650"  >
</div>
